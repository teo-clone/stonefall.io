when are my objects ever checked:
	canvas.js
	game.js
	websockets.java
	websockets.js has one call but idk where it goes
	handlers.js
	penciller.js

need to change the fact that I'm passing objects and a subset of objects, that's bad code

new game translation mechanism
	(1) need to get user's current window
		and any players they have selected already 
	(2) for each object in the game
		(a) check whose coordinates it is in
		(b) add it to that person's payload
	...now we have a payload per player in their window
