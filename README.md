# Stonefall

Stonefall is a real-time strategy massively multiplayer game.

## Compiling and Running

To run Stonefall, simply [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), clone this repo, and run 
`mvn clean && mvn package -DskipTests && ./run --gui` from the root directory. 

Stonefall will then be accessible from localhost:4567. Then, people on your local network can go to your IP address and play Stonefall along with you at the same time! Or, to try multiplayer yourself, you can open multiple tabs and make different players :)
